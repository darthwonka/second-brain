<p></p>
<p>She also has experienced trauma in the form of verbal retaliation to her inquiries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She didn't intentionally try to hurt my feelings or make me feel a way, what she said and how she said it did hurt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I expressed that it hurt me and she felt that I was yelling at her without warrant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She called me at 10pm #1. #2 accusingly asked what was on my screen as I was shutting it down. These are facts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But she did not hear me tell her on the phone what I was doing. So that part is probably a misunderstanding. Also a fact.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was feeling anxious because it was so late -- and that she felt she had to come into my office. It made me very jumpy -- anticipating judgement or criticism.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When she asked what was on my screen, it was her addressing her insecurities and I am supposed to be kind and considerate to that question and not get defensive. Being defensive in this situation justified in her mind, the line of questioning. I get it. But I don't like it.</p>
<p></p></td>
<td><p>I think in this situation the problem is one of emotional justification. I feel hurt therefore someone is at fault.</p>

<p>It is also habitual. I feel guilty for having to work late and I do not want her to think I am doing anything other than what I said I was doing. That guilt makes me more sensitive to criticism.</p>

In 20 minutes of telling me why I am sick, unmedicated, yelling, out of control, cruel, racist, and other things, she said she only meant to find out if I am busy.. But because she is from NY and this is how she talks, there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sticking to the fact, felt like looping, I got even more tired. A full hour of this. She explained herself and it was a control thing.. She wanted to determine if what I was working on was something she could interrupt.</p>
