Listed below are several different patterns of problematic thinking that people use in different

life situations. These patterns often become automatic, habitual thoughts that cause people to

engage in self-defeating behavior. Considering your own Stuck Points, or samples from your everyday

thinking, find examples for each of these patterns. Write in the Stuck Point or typical thought

under the appropriate pattern, and describe how it fits that pattern. Think about how that pattern

affects you.

1. Jumping to conclusions or predicting the future.
2. Exaggerating or minimizing a situation (blowing things way out of proportion or shrink­ing their importance inappropriately}.
3. Ignoring important parts of a situation.
4. Oversimplifying things as "good-bad" or "right-wrong."
5. Overgeneralizing from a single incident (e.g., a negative event is seen as a never-ending pattern).
6. Mind reading (assuming that people are thinking negatively of you when there is no defi­nite evidence for this).
7. Emotional reasoning (using your emotions as proof-e.g., "I feel fear, so I must be in danger").
