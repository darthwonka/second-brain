HANDOUT9.4

Power/Control Issues Module

Power and Control Beliefs Related to

challenges that you may face.

Beliefs that you can solve problems and meet

PRIOR EXPERIENCE

Negative Positive

If you grew up experiencing repeated negative events, you may have developed the belief that you

cannot control events or solve problems even if they are controllable/ solvable. A new traumatic

event may seem to confirm prior beliefs about helplessness.

If you grew up believing that you had control over events and could solve problems, the traumatic

event may have disrupted those beliefs.

Symptoms Associated with Negative Power/Control Beliefs about the Self

• Numbing of feelings

• Avoidance of emotions

• Chronic passivity

• Hopelessness and depression

• Self-destructive patterns

• Outrage when you are faced with events that are out of your control, or with people who do not

behave as you would like

Examples of Possible Stuck Points

"Because I can't be completely in control, I might as well be out of control." "The traumatic event

wouldn't have happened if I had had better control over it." "I need to be perfect to be in

control."

"If I lose complete control over my emotions, something bad will happen."

POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS

If you previously believed that...

"I have control over everything that I do and say, as well as over the actions of others," then it

will be important to realize that none of us can have complete control over our emotions or

behavior at all times. Although you may be able to influence many external events, it is impossible

to control all events or

all behaviors of other people. Neither of these

A possible alternative thought may be...

"I do not have total control over my reactions, other people, or events at all times. However, I am

able to have some control over my reactions to events, and to influence some behaviors of others or

the outcomes of some events."

"Bad things do not always happen when I am not in control."

Symptoms Associated with Negative Power/Control Beliefs about Others

• Passivity

• Submissiveness

• Lack of assertiveness that can generalize to all relationships

• Inability to maintain relationships, because you do not allow the other per­ sons to exert any

control in the relationships (including becoming enraged if the other persons try to exert even a

minimal amount of control)

Examples of Possible Stuck Points

"People will always try to control you."

"There is no point in even trying to fight against authority."

"This event just proves that people have too much power over me."

POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS

If you previously believe.

"I am powerless and have no co­ relationships," then you will need to learn ways that it is safe

and appropriate for you to exert control over yourself, others, and events.

"I have to control everything in the lives of people I care about, or they will be hurt," then the

traumatic event may have further reinforced this belief. It will be important for you to realize

that healthy relationships

involve sharing power and control, and that relationships in which one person has all the

Possible alternative thoughts may be...

"Even though I cannot always get everything I want in a relationship, I do have the ability to

influence others by standing up assertively for my rights and asking for what I want."

"Even though I may not get everything I want or need out of a relationship, I can assert myself and

ask for it. A good relationship is one in which power is balanced between both people. If I am not

allowed any control, I can exert my control in this relationship by ending it, if necessary."
