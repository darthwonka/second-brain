2/18/2023 0:00		I can't trust anyone so no one can be trusted.Â 	1. I have put my trust in my Mom to help me understand the world.  I used to feel like an alien. 	1. Jumping to conclusions, usually.  But I have also avoided relationships because I anticipated	A. Alternative Thought
		I feel alone and lost. 90%	I have put my trust in my first wife.  She cheated on me.  I trusted friends to look out for me, they made fun of me.	2. I exaggerate .    A HINT of something is not right is enough to conclude something is up. 	Sometimes people will unintentionally violate your trust.  Evaluate the offence against the person's character and the circumstances.   Did I not hear something?  Perhaps I misunderstood the agreement or conversation. 
			1. I have had friends who were with me through tough times.  They truly cared.  	3. It ignores the situation a lot, it ignores who is the target of my mistrust.  They didn't necessarily betray me nor give me real reasons to feel mistrust. 	Check the apprehension against what you know, what is happening, your environment and other facts.
			My wife has even been recognized in my custody hearings as 'incredibly credible'.  I don't think she has ever lied to me.	4. It never seems simple	
			1. Habit -- or expectation 	5. It has been a couple incidents, but they were painful.. I have also once picked up a hot coal.  	A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
			2. It feels like recognizing coals can be hot and treating all coals like that.	6. I am always assuming there is a negative thought.   My wife has expressions on her face of disgust, or anger.. But come to find out those were not the emotions she was feeling. 	
			3. I often feel like I will dive in with no boundaries or protection with someone's trust but at the first hint of betrayal, I am out.   That seems a little extreme. 		50%
			4. It is confusing possible with likely   		
					A. Emotion(s)
					Hopeful. 
2/11/2023 0:00	When I speak up about my boundaries or if something is hurting me, it is dismissed.	Rules and boundaries only apply to everyone else	1. When I try to put down a boundary for myself, and Nicole crosses it, my response makes me the villain even though it was my boundary that was violated. 	I feel like this is exaggerated emotional reasoning with a hefty helping of mindreading.	A. Alternative Thought
		Hurt 90%	2. I may not understand how to put down boundaries.  Or what that looks like.  Poor implementation of this could be an issue. 		What feels like hypocrisy and dismissal, could be a misunderstanding.   It is possible that I am hyperfocused on my hurt feelings that I am not being graceful and considering the other person's unspoken motives or beliefs. 
			3. This could be a habitual feeling as I often think that my feelings never matter.  It could expectation too.  I expect to be dismissed or invalidated. 	The slightest emotional discomfort often results in me getting more and more heated as the offending party insists that the problem is mine alone.   It is frustrating. 	
			4. I do tend to focus on myself in these cases and often don't want to address the other person's feelings on the matter unless they first recognize that they hurt me. 		
				The more they defend their position and belittle or just not acknowledge that what they did could have hurt me, the more I believe the stuck point.	A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
					65%   -- this one is really hard for me.  No matter how I ask for something, it doesn't seem like they are willing to budge.    They will still say things that trigger me -- causing me to work even harder at emotional regulation.   It already feels like I am playing life on 'hurt me plenty', it feels unfair that they won't just consider my feelings.
				How do you communicate the offense or perceived offense in a way that doesn't belittle the other person or make them double down?    	A. Emotion(s)
					Heart hurts.   Feeling alone.   Feeling like a fuckup.
2/15/2023 0:00	Feeling good and productive, Nicole comes in and lets me know that I let her down or did something wrong.	When I feel happy and everything is okay, something is not okay and I have done something wrong or missed something.  70_%	1. There have been many times where I was feeling good about the work I am doing or just in general, someone points out where I fucked up.   	This is habitual and exaggerated.  I have accomplished good things and got the kudos before without any negative consequences or being corrected.  	A. Alternative Thought
		fearful, Anxiety	2. This doesn't happen every time.   And while this is a possible reality, it is not a certain reality.   		While there is always a chance that I have missed something, I shouldn't feel so much guilt or shame about it.  Take pride in the accomplishment, bask in it.   If someone points out something you didn't do, don't trash all the work you did over it.   And don't feel like they are just picking  on you.   Remember who it is that is saying what they are saying.
			3. Like pavlovs dogs, I start feeling the anxiety as soon as I recognize that I am feeling good about the situation.  	I tend to put my worth in the wrong places.   I should not put my worth in the imaginary mind of my partner.   I should speak up so that I know where she is coming from. 	A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point

3/7/2023 0:00	Missed or missing bills and I need help	I must hide my problems	1. I will often get paralyzed by problems that I don't have a solution for.   No money?  Well I can't call the bank to stop anything because I have nothing to offer in return.  I can't ask for help from my wife because she has her own bills and things she wants.  	Habitual + ADHD executive function blocks.	A. Alternative Thought
		Shame		I assume that I will be perceived poorly if I need help or that I won't get help when I ask for it.  	It is okay to ask for help.  It is okay to make mistakes.   If you cannot do something, it is sometimes okay to get help -- even if it is just someone listening to the problem.
			I often feel like asking for help is confirmation that I cannot take care of myself or that I am inadequate. 		A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
				I donâ€™t  have any reason to believe my wife would withhold help if asked.  	50%

3/9/2023 0:00	Nicole was having a rough start and could not find something.. She started complaining about all the things she has that get misplaced and mentioned the boys and I.	I must defend myself against false accusations.			A. Alternative Thought

3/17/2023 17:32	I woke up having to go to the bathroom and was immediately concerned that I would not be able to get back to sleep.				A. Alternative Thought
		Everyone is allowed to complain to me.  But how dare I complain about anything.			A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
	Nicole was waking up already and started to talk to me as I was putting my mask back on.  I told her I wanted to keep sleeping.   I might have been a little rude the second time.  	Wronged, Betrayed.			A. Emotion(s)
	Then she taps my shoulder 4 times.   After I turned over looking annoyed, she tried to explain it away. 				
					
	Then she is mumbling to herself about me giving her the silent treatment (as I attempted again to sleep), about 4 minutes of that and suddenly my bed is rising to the sitting position.   I snapped out - 'are you fucking kidding me!'   -- she says she didn't mean to do that, but damn the timing and circumstances.				
					
	All that was annoying, but not triggering.  The trigger seemed to be about how I cannot complain or express myself without retaliation. 				
3/24/2023	I was telling Nicole about my day and how productive I feel by paying bills.   She interjected 'did you pay timmy back?"  I was hurt.    In my mind I am considering everything and paid things that would impact our lives if they were to shut off (power, cable, taxes, etc).   I felt like once again, I was feeling good and missed something	When I feel happy and everything is okay, something is not okay and I have done something wrong or missed something.	She was reminding me to pay Timmy, she was not pointing out that I missed something.		A. Alternative Thought
		Upset, defensive			A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
					A. Emotion(s)
3/30/2023	Had to work late because we had a friend come by for a couple hours.  I spent time, we had dinner, we chilled.. I went back up to work a couple more hours.   At 10pm, Nicole called me on the phone from the bedroom, but apparently didn't hear my last few sentences.   She came in for clarification as I was shutting down my systems.   She immediately asked what was just on my screen that I quickly closed.  She tells me it is a legit question that she is entitled to ask because of her trauma.  What about my trauma?  What about making me feel like I am under a microscope and not trustworthy?  Same shit as always.	If I am not 100% transparent, I must be doing something covertly.  (80%)	Nicole has past trauma and it overlaps with mine.   She has a problem with trusting because people have betrayed her in the past.  	I think in this situation the problem is one of emotional justification.  I feel hurt therefore someone is at fault.	A. Alternative Thought
					Nicole is having a hard time and while she said to work as much as I could to cut hours tomorrow.
		When I am feeling productive and accomplished, someone is always there to point out where I failed -- or question what it was I was working on.  (80%)	She also has experienced trauma in the form of verbal retaliation to her inquiries. 	It is also habitual.  I feel guilty for having to work late and I do not want her to think I am doing anything other than what I said I was doing.   That guilt makes me more sensitive to criticism.	She was also feeling lonely and neglected which made her feel like she needed to investigate.   I did nothing wrong and should not feel so heavily judged/criticized.  I don't think she expected me to be working that long into the night and I was pretty hyper-focused on what I was doing. 
		Upset, defensive			
			She didn't intentionally try to hurt my feelings or make me feel a way, what she said and how she said it did hurt. 	 Being in a situation where I have to work more or odd hours causes me anxiety with the lack of trust between us.	A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
					70% -- Lower, but I am having to convince myself of the alternative thought as my feelings are pretty strong towards the negative.
			I expressed that it hurt me and she felt that I was yelling at her without warrant.  		A. Emotion(s)
					Misunderstood, emotionally exhausted. 
			She called me at 10pm #1.  #2 accusingly asked what was on my screen as I was shutting it down.   These are facts. 		
					
			But she did not hear me tell her on the phone what I was doing.  So that part is probably a misunderstanding.  Also a fact.   		
					
			I was feeling anxious because it was so late -- and that she felt she had to come into my office.   It made me very jumpy -- anticipating judgement or criticism. 		
					
			When she asked what was on my screen, it was her addressing her insecurities and I am supposed  to be kind and considerate to that question and not get defensive.  Being defensive in this situation justified in her mind, the line of questioning.   I get it.   But I don't like it. 		
					
5/23/2023	I was once again at my desk and finishing up on my days tasks and making notes.   I had already shutdown my personal computer.   Nicole was working on getting her clothes situated from after her trip and with the awkward work of getting prepared to move my son back in the house from college.	If I get close to someone, I will get hurt.  If I express that something hurts, I get punished. 	My perception of what was happening was spot on.   This was not an over-reaction nor mis-interpretation.   This was a real act of dominance that she did not want to admit to. 	I honestly felt the pain, was a little sarcastic, but otherwise, held it together and queried what she meant by that statement.	A. Alternative Thought
		Tired. Hopeless. Anxious			A. Re-Rate Old Thought/Stuck Point
	She came in, looked at me, sat down, and said "What are you doing right now? "  		I asked for a power exchange in this situation.   Ask me if I am busy.. Let me have that.   I do the same consistently.  This is apparently too hard for her.  In 20 minutes of telling me why I am sick, unmedicated, yelling, out of control, cruel, racist, and other things, she said she only meant to find out if  I am busy..  But because she is from NY and this is how she talks, there is nothing wrong with it. 	She told me and it was exactly how I perceived it.   We had spoke about the last situation (right above here), and it was clear that I had the feeling and reaction (I feel hurt and someone is to blame )..	A. Emotion(s)
					
	I started typing faster and then started shutting things down.. "You need me to do something.. Let me drop everything to help"  yes.. I was not happy.   		Sticking to the fact, felt like looping, I got even more tired.   A full hour of this.   She explained herself and it was a control thing..  She wanted to determine if what I was working on was something she could interrupt. 	I explained that She often makes me feel powerless and out of my own control. 	
					
	I took a breath and asked her what she meant by that.. She said she meant to assess what I was working on and if I can be interrupted.		I felt that while I initially felt a way with my feelings, I backed it up with facts.  	I feel like I am under a microscope and that all of my actions are being appraised and judged as to if I am allowed to do it. 	
					
	I told her "That is what it felt like."   I said that I don't like it when I feel like I can't even manage my own time or activities.  I asked her to instead, put that in my court by asking me "are you busy?".    Argument ensued.  			This is my stuck point.   But in this case, it is totally right!  She was controlling my time and and deciding if what I was doing was worth it.	
					
	She did exactly what hurt, but still bears no responsibility nor understanding of why that may be wrong. 			WTF do I do now?  	
					
	I'm tired.
