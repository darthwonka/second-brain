Virtual machine created, but we need to upgrade the servers and clients to get this server running. 
The upgrade will also entail turning off the Info Exchange services on Skynet


The Hostname `portal.studiocompletiva.com` needs to resolve to this server after it is created. 
Currently [SKYNET](999-Archive/StudioCompletiva/Office-Operations-Notebook/Infrastructure/Servers/NEWFORMA/SKYNET.md) has this address assigned.
