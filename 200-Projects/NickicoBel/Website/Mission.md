BeauÂ·ty:

The quality present in a thing or person that gives intense pleasure or deep satisfaction to the mind, whether arising from sensory manifestations (as shape, color, sound, etc.), a meaningful design or pattern, or something else (as a personality in which high spiritual qualities are manifest).

By definition physical beauty is personal attractiveness and a pleasing personal appearance. Physical attractiveness often exudes sexual desirability, self confidence and allure to those around you.

We are all born with a natural attraction but some of us choose to enhance our exquisiteness with the help of a talented professional like Nickico
