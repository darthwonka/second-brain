Nicki has been doing my hair for nearly a year, she's the only person I trust to touch my hair. After having been through several bad so-called stylist I didn't think I could trust anybody else. Nicki is always on point with how she installs the extensions, I always leave her feeling super sexy! The only reason I recently stopped seeing Nicki is because I moved out of state:(However, she's always been available for text or calls to answer any questions I might have. You will not regret seeing Nicki.

Nicole is the only stylist I trust to touch my hair. I'm undergoing chemotherapy. Nicole is the only stylist who has been able to safely color my hair. She is great at helping me find hair styles and products to manage and protect my ever-changing texture and thickness. My hair is constantly shifting from wavy to very curly due to my meds; Nicole knows how to keep it looking good!
