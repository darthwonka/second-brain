#  Updates

I am terrible with keeping up with friends and family.  This is not a secret to those I consider my friends. They know me.. When we get together again, it is like we never left.

## Why?

Because I am a little paranoid and upset with the current fascist move on the Internet:  Between [censorship](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=censorship+on+social+media&t=ffab&df=y&ia=news)
[profiteering](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=your+data+for+sale+on+social+media&t=ffab&df=y), and [disinformation](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=disinformation+problem&t=ffab&df=y), I would rather start limiting my usage of certain platforms and outright stop using others.  

Now I prefer decentralized social media such as [Mastedon](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/what-is-mastodon)
For secure messaging, I am bound by apple iMessage for 90% but I do prefer using [Signal](https://www.signal.org) as it is very secure and can follow my phone number.  

### Sigh.. Reddit.   How could you?!
This last week [Reddit](https://futurism.com/the-byte/scandal-reddit-horrible), my former go-to for information and community, decided to upend so much of what made it great!  It essentially shutdown its API for 3rd party apps and basically crippled the platform.   

### TikTok has a lot of merit
With all the [fuss with TikTok](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-lawmakers-seek-new-law-protect-tiktok-user-information-2023-06-14/), which is doing what EVERY OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORM is doing --  monatizing the user data.   
It pisses me off because you, at the moment, can get a real vibe for people in various communities and really get to know the 'content makers'.    While I do see issues with things like "shadow banning" and other issues that might need to get addressed, the fear in government is the free thoughts flowing.   Real accounts and real people telling you their experiences makes it so much more engaging than Twitter.
