SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION

  

1. Purpose and Intent
    
      
    
    The following Design and Architectural Standards (“DAS”) have been prepared to ensure that the goals and vision are realized for properties in the Planned Community known as Fox Run. The initial DAS were prepared in 1996 as part of the initial development requirements of the community. The first major revision to the standards occurred in June, 2002. The revisions were warranted as a result of the Fox run community being substantially developed. As such, there was no longer need for developer or homebuilder involvement at the post construction stage. There are, however, several elements of the DAS, which require revision, or updating, to meet the evolving desires of the residents of Fox Run. Current update August 2012 The purpose of these DAS is to provide specific design criteria for the subsequent improvement or modification of individual homes and for the development and subsequent improvement or modification of landscapes within the community. The DAS are designed to establish and maintain a quality community appearance, assure compatibility, direct character and form, and enhance value. The DAS is intended to be flexible as required to meet evolving community requirements. The regulations herein may be subject to revision over time. These standards are intended to augment and compliment the project Declaration of Protective Covenants. The primary concept behind the DAS has been, and continues to be, recognition of the following:
    
    - A sense of quality and permanence in a residential community is achieved, primarily, by visual harmony of the project’s site planning, architectural design and landscape design.
        
    - A multitude of discordant visual elements works against the above mentioned concept.
        
    - The privacy of rear yards is the appropriate place for display of personally unique items or features.
        
    - The concept of precedent plays an important role in the establishment and enforcement of community guidelines. We, as a community, must limit our own “freedom” of expression.
        
        The DAS also allow individual identity; yet complement an overall community theme. While the DAS ensure that each home relates to the overall community image, they do not inhibit innovative landscape design. They provide clear direction and specific criteria for evolving an overall sense of community. To this end, homeowners and their consultants are encouraged to review this entire document to better understand the relationship of each building site, or home, to the total design goals of the community. All residential development within Fox Run must abide by the applicable criteria established by these DAS in addition to the zoning development standards established by the City of Northglenn and by the Fox Run Declaration (covenants).
        
2. Community Concept and Character
    
    The Community design concept for Fox Run provides for residential homes to be linked by public roadways and pedestrian walks. An extensively landscaped perimeter treatment is punctuated by entries to the community and project signage. Fox Run Parkway provides direct vehicular access to the individual neighborhoods in Fox Run with special focus on the three public parks.
    
3. Relationship of Design and Architectural Standards to Other Regulations
    
    The DAS are not intended to supersede applicable federal, Colorado, or Northglenn codes or ordinances. In case of conflict or discrepancy, or for subjects not addressed in the DAS, the more restrictive DAS, governing agencies, codes and/or regulations shall take precedence. The DAS are to be used by homeowner and their design consultants as a guide and framework for their efforts to develop homes and landscapes within Fox Run. The DAS are also to be used by owners when modifying or upgrading homes or landscaping on individual properties within Fox Run. The Das will also be used by the Fox Run Design Review Committee (“DRC”) in reviewing proposals to determine their relative conformance to the overall design objectives and criteria. The DAS are intended to cover each site specific or lot specific issue, and community issues such as edge treatments and relationships to adjacent land uses. The DAS are to be used in conjunction with the recorded Declaration.
    
4. How to Use the Design and Architectural Standards
    The DAS are organized into major elements such as Site Planning and Design, Architectural Design and Landscape Design and procedural sections such as Submittal Requirements and Construction Period Regulations. Each element is introduced with a description of intent followed by specific items within each element.
    
    There are no established “number” of design criteria that must be met in each proposal. The relationship between design variables is dynamic, and each combination of elements is perceived differently. The DAS identify those elements that should be considered, and define performance characteristics the elements should have – but there is no “standard formula” for an “appropriate” design solution. In all instances, the DRC will consider the interrelationship of the design variables, and the specific criteria.

    SECTION 2 SITE PLANNING AND DESIGN
    
      
    
    1. Accessory Structures
        
        Accessory structures, i.e., “storage sheds,” “potting sheds,” etc., must meet strict criteria for size and design. Maximum size is not to exceed 100 square feet; maximum height, at the peak of a pitched roof, is not to exceed 8 feet. Architectural detailing such as roof material, trim, siding and doors should match the original architecture of the home as much as is practical. The color of the shed components must match the original architecture of the home. On those properties where the 8 foot height results in a strong visual presence from a public right of way or adjacent property, architectural detailing in the form of additional trim, windows, and siding will be considered an integral component of dominant structure visibility. No metal or plastic sheds will be allowed. Ground mounted storage lockers or bins constructed of wood or vinyl is acceptable if properly located. See Addendum Accessory Structures.
        
    2. Concrete Driveways/Walkways
        
        Concrete driveways and parking areas are not to be expanded or widened without prior approval. No more parking spaces for automobiles than originally constructed for each property will be allowed. This relates to the original design of the various homes which provide for one car in the driveway behind one garage space, two driveway spaces behind two garage spaces, or three driveway spaces behind three garage spaces. A 24” wide walkway may parallel a driveway space linking the front door to the sidewalk along the street. This 24” walkway must be constructed of some type of brick or concrete paver not poured concrete. Walkways linking the front yard area to the rear yard may be constructed of concrete, but should not exceed 24” in width.
        
    3. Dog Runs
        
        Dog runs will be allowed if they can be reasonably isolated and screened from adjacent properties. Height of fencing cannot exceed 5 feet. If a chain link type of enclosure is used, it cannot be visible from a public right of way. Local ordinances regarding noise, odors and other nuisances will be in effect and enforced by both Northglenn and the HOA. Animals are not to be left in dog runs on a continuous basis and dog runs should provide proper shade for pets.
        
    4. Gardens
        
        Vegetable gardens will be allowed in rear yards. Flower gardens are encouraged in the front or side yards as a complement to the landscape installed by the builders. Reference Section 4 Landscape Design for additional information.
        
    5. Parking/storage of Recreation and Inoperative Vehicles
        
        It is a function of the City of Northglenn zoning approval for Fox Run that the following applies: No recreation vehicles, inoperable or disassembled or partially disassembled vehicles of any type, shall be parked, stored, maintained, or used in the front yard or driveway of any dwelling, or on any public street in the plan unit development (PUD), but may be stored within the fully enclosed garage of that dwelling. However, recreation vehicles and motor homes may be temporarily parked for a maximum of three (3) consecutive days in the driveway, or visually screened in the side or rear yard of the residence, provided that vehicle does not interfere with the sight views and/or use of adjacent property. Recreation vehicles shall include, but not be limited to motor homes, pickup trucks with campers, unlicensed motorcycles, trailers, motor bikes, snowmobiles, jet skis, all terrain vehicles, and other apparatus intended for use on land, water, or the air, and the trailers for their transportation. Inoperative vehicles shall include, but not be limited to unlicensed vehicles, vehicles with expired tags, vehicles with flat tires or body damage prohibiting the vehicle to move under its own propulsion.
        
    6. Elements Unique to the Kimblewyck Neighborhood
        
        The Kimblewyck neighborhood has been developed as a separate and unique “lifestyle” opportunity in Fox Run. The project was conceived as a blend of traditional housing in a “neo traditional” or “new urbanism” setting. The project is characterized by homes which front onto streets or open spaces, rear loading garages from private streets and areas of private open spaces.
        
        The private streets, or lanes, should never be considered alleys. The intent is to have each homeowner provide uniform fencing with appropriate landscaping to form a “streetscape”. The private drives double as fire lanes, therefore no parking can be allowed. The fencing design provides yard enclosure with a uniform visual presence on the private drive, and is designed to also allow reasonable view opportunities when entering or exiting a garage
        
        ![image](file:///C:/Users/salus/Documents/hoa-requirementspdf_files/Image_006.gif)
        
        or driveway onto the private drive. The fencing is a function of the project approvals at the City of Northglenn; therefore there can be no variation. Based upon the necessity to maintain the private components of the neighborhood, a separate homeowner’s association has been put in place functioning as a sub association to the Master Fox Run Owner’s Association. See Addendum E Kimblewyck Village Fencing and Landscaping
        
    7. Elements Unique to the Kensington Neighborhood
        
        The Kensington neighborhood consists entirely of townhouse residential units. Each residential unity is a component in a townhouse structure consisting of four or more attached residential units. While being primarily designed to function as fee simple units on public streets, small elements, in conjunction with the shared architectural elements such as exterior siding and roofing, require the existence of a separate homeowner’s association which functions as a sub association to the Master Fox Run Owner’s Association.
        
    8. Elements unique to Attached Housing Paired Homes and Townhomes
        
    
    The design of the attached units and the method of legal ownership combine to require that care are taken when implementing exterior improvements. No new construction for one unit should be physically attached to an adjacent unit, nor should anything owned by a homeowner be attached or hung on the wall of an adjacent unit. Due to the small private rear yards, especially in the Kensington townhouse neighborhood, hard surface patios are discouraged wood decks are encouraged to allow minimum impact on the area drainage systems.
    
    ![image](file:///C:/Users/salus/Documents/hoa-requirementspdf_files/Image_007.gif)
    
    SECTION 3 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS
    
    1. Purpose and Intent
        
        The architectural character of the homes in Fox Run is intended to reflect regional character with a variety of interesting and compatible relationships of form, texture and style. Additionally, economic factors, environmental concerns, and construction practices prevalent in the industry are important influences. These DAS are intended to promote a high level of design quality, assure compatibility between residential products within the community, and guide character and form. Together, these key components comprise an essential part of the Fox Run image. The architectural theme for Fox Run has been established by the Declarant and is best characterized by a commitment to regional design styles that demonstrate form elements with shadow lines, building materials with strong textures, and exterior colors complimentary to the natural environment. There is no single “correct” architectural style for homes in Fox run, yet all design elements are expected to relate clearly to the established design theme. This identification and compatibility with the established architectural theme is expected to be achieved at all levels of design identification, including individual dwellings, “street scenes,” and the total community.
        
    2. Color
        
        The original color palette of the community was generally subdued to blend with the colors of the natural landscape, muted color tones were preferred. New color palettes have been approved for the community which includes bolder colors to accommodate the change in style. Color brochures are available at the Sherwin Williams
        
        store located north of 112th on Washington. All exterior painting must be submitted for approval; even the pre approved colors must be submitted as well as repainting of the same colors. When submitting pre approved colors from the Sherwin Williams brochures, it is necessary to include the name of the specific brochure, the scheme number of the colors chosen. The color schemes must be used in the same format they are listed, color for body must be used for the body, trim must be used for the trim and accent for accent. No deviation will be approved. No homes within three on either side should be painted the same color scheme to help allow for variation within the community. A 12”x 12” should be painted on the garage door so the DRC can see the paint on the home prior to approval. Use of highly chromatic or “bright” colors is to be avoided. Repainting of the homes is anticipated every three to five years and homeowners are encouraged to budget appropriately. Flat or satin finish paint is required; semi gloss or gloss paint will not be approved. Homeowners should not contract for home painting prior to receiving committee approval.
        
    3. Materials
        
        Exterior surfaces shall be of natural and such other materials that blend and are compatible with the community and the landscape. The use of each material shall be a truthful and appropriate expression of the characteristics of that particular material. Use of brick, wood, stucco and stone is preferred. Exposed concrete blocks, painted concrete, multi colored masonry, mirrored glass, metal siding, prefabricated metal buildings, simulated brick, unnatural brick tones, and silver finish aluminum doors and windows shall not be acceptable. These items can include artificial vents, gable detailing, window boxes, and “wafer thick” brick stone. Contemporary artificial stone, which is a full dimension material, will be considered.
        
    4. Roofs
        
        All roofs shall be of a material, color and texture approved by the DRC. Metal roofs are not acceptable. Wood, wood like asphalt, fiberglass or concrete shingles is acceptable. Replacement material should be the same quality or better and the shingle shall match the original texture and color. No maximum or minimum pitch is specified, but approval by the DRC will be based on the visual impact of the roof on the property and/or on neighboring properties, dwellings and roads. Excessively steep roofs or roofs less than a 4:12 pitch are discouraged. The general appearance of the dwelling will be an important consideration.
        
    5. Building Projections – Massing of Components
        
        All projections including, but not limited to, chimney flues, vents, gutters, downspouts, porches, railings and exterior stairways, shall match the color of the surface from which they project or shall be of an approved color. Vents are to be painted to blend with the roofing. Patio covers constructed of cedar or redwood of the lattice or trellis designs are encouraged. Compatibility with a deck is appropriate. Patio covers that are designed as architectural extensions of the home must utilize the design, materials and colors of the home. Enclosure of the underside of this type of patio cover is required. Verification of structural integrity may be required.
        
        
    6. Garages
        
        The residential structure or complex on single family lots shall include a garage of a size sufficient to accommodate a minimum of two (2) full sized automobiles and a maximum to be approved by the DRC. Garage doors shall be oriented for minimum impact on the “streetscape” and shall be painted the same color as either the trim color or body color of the home and not a contrasting color. Garage space shall not be converted to living space or utilized
        
        ![image](file:///C:/Users/salus/Documents/hoa-requirementspdf_files/Image_008.gif)
        
        for excessive storage if it precludes parking of an automobile. At the end of the day, automobiles should be placed in the garage, not parked on the street or on the driveway. Garage doors must be kept in the down position as defined in the covenants.
        
    7. Antennas/Satellite Dishes/Solar Panels
        
        The DAS recognizes and adheres to all local, state and federal regulations concerning antennas and dishes. No one will be denied use of a recognizable system. However, the location of the equipment must be approved by the DRC. There are always alternate locations for the required equipment. Location above the eaves of the roof is generally not necessary for dishes. Inconspicuous locations under the eaves are encouraged. Locations over the home’s entry or other visually conspicuous locations are to be discouraged. Cables should be hidden or located in a non obtrusive location. Cables should be colored to blend with the color of the home. Black cables, not hidden, are discouraged. One satellite dish is allowed per home pursuant to the approval of the DRC. Large satellite dishes will be prohibited in favor of smaller (18”) varieties unless otherwise approved by the DRC. Solar panels shall be ground mounted or laid flat on the same plane as the roof. Solar panels shall not be built on stilts.
        
        KENSINGTON TOWNHOUSES SATELLITE DISHES AND SOLAR PANELS
        
        Satellite dishes are not allowed to be mounted on siding or roofs, dishes are to be mounted on trim boards only and require pre approval of the DRC. Solar panels are not allowed on the roofs of the Kensington townhouses, the Kensington Association owns and maintains the roofs in the community and homeowners are not to place any items on the roof which would compromise its integrity or cause damage to the shingles.
        
    8. Storm Doors/Security Doors
        
        Storm doors, as shown on Addendum B Storm Doors/Security Doors are allowed. The approved list of doors is intended to provide simplicity of design and minimize intrusion of non harmonious colors at the entry of the homes. While addressing the interest of some homeowners who favor a security door over a storm door, the DRC will not consider requests for bars or other physical security devices to be placed over windows.
        
    9. Mailboxes/Address Markers
        
        As with other elements of “street furniture,” allowable alternatives for mailboxes have been kept to a minimum. See Addendum C Mailboxes for samples of acceptable mailbox designs. Address markers, or numbers, other than those provided with the home, are allowable. Specialized markers or numbers made of ceramic, brass or other material may be used providing the numbers are no larger than the numbers originally provided with the house. Placement by the front door, porch or centered over the garage door is acceptable.
        
    10. Flags
        
          
        
        The only flag suitable for display in Fox Run is the American flag. Residentially scaled flags, approximately 3’ x 5’, or smaller, are appropriate. If mounted on a flag holder, the holder should be placed near the entry to the home on a porch column or other appropriate location, which would allow ease of flag placement and removal. Pole mounts are discouraged, but if requested, should be residentially scaled at a 12 foot maximum. Placement must be within appropriate parameters of the home and landscaping. Strict adherence to proper rules and regulations for displaying the American flag are expected. Because there are those who would choose to display flags, which
        
          
        
        9
        
        ![image](file:///C:/Users/salus/Documents/hoa-requirementspdf_files/Image_009.gif)
        
        are generally considered offensive by our society, all other flags, other than the American flag are not allowed in Fox Run.
        
    11. Patriotic/Seasonal/Celebratory Displays
        
        Patriotic, seasonal, and celebratory displays are encouraged in Fox Run. Acknowledgment of individual origin, pride in citizenship or country, recognition of holidays such as July 4th, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc., and unique days of graduation or anniversaries are all expected. Displays should be residentially scaled. Removal of each display should occur within a week of the end of the celebration. Christmas holiday lights and décor must be removed no later than February 1st.
        
          
        
    12. Basketball Goals
        
          
        
        Public facilities for playing basketball by the “big kids” have been provided by the Cities of Northglenn and Thornton in easily accessible locations, including Fox Run’s North, Central and South Parks. Moveable and storable temporary goals are allowed for the “smaller kids”; the goals must be kept on owner’s lot and not on the sidewalks or in the streets. Preferably goals should be stored in the garage or side yard behind the wing fence when not in use. No permanent goal backboards may be mounted on the home. Permanent goals on poles may be mounted on the “short side” of the yard. Goal posts should be flat black or flat green in color. Backboards should be devoid of graphic enhancement. Transparent backboards are encouraged.
        
          
        
    13. Air Conditioners/Swamp Coolers
        
          
        
        Ground mounted air conditioning equipment can be located adjacent to the exterior wall of the home in the rear yard or behind the wing fences in the side yards. Window mounted air conditioners and swamp coolers can be installed in upper windows only if they are removed during fall and winter months (Approximately October to April), units cannot be left in windows year round. Any supporting structure must be painted to match the home.
        
          
        
    14. Trash Containers
        
          
        
        In compliance with the Northglenn City Municipal Code (11 7 2). When trash containers are not out for pickup they must be stored in the rear yard behind the fence or in the garage. Containers are not to be left in driveway or the front of the home exposed to the street. (Kensington Townhomes Excluded)
        
          
        
    15. Building Code
        
    
      
    
    All structures will conform to all applicable building codes and ordinances. Approval by the DRC does not constitute or imply compliance with such codes and ordinances.
    
      
    
    SECTION 4 – LANDSCPAING DESIGN
    
      
    
    1. Purpose and Intent
        
          
        
        The Landscape Design criteria are intended to supplement the Site Planning and Architecture Design criteria to integrate structures into the community. Additionally, landscaping should have compatibility with adjacent
        
        10
        
        ![image](file:///C:/Users/salus/Documents/hoa-requirementspdf_files/Image_010.gif)
        
        properties, the project’s streetscape, and ultimately transition into perimeter landscaping. The DRC reserves the right to require landscape components as a part of the architectural approval, if in the opinion of the DRC; the architectural design needs specific assistance to meet the intent of the design standards. It is the intent of the criteria to perpetuate a residential landscape, which maximizes lawn and landscaped areas while minimizing areas of rock, concrete or other non live material. As such, a minimum of 75% of a yard area should consist of live material. Landscape concepts, which promote non live elements, will not be allowed.
        
          
        
    2. Timing and Components
        
          
        
        Front yard landscaping of single family lots is provided by the homebuilder as part of the initial sales package. All other landscaping (i.e. rear and side yard landscaping) is the obligation of the owner. The DRC requires complete landscaping plans for rear and side yard landscaping with confirmation of the intent to carry out acceptable landscape construction practices. At the time of, or when possible following construction of the residential structure on a property, but not later than one (1) year following the closing or first occupancy of a home, whichever occurs first, the rear and side yard shall be suitably landscaped with grass, shrubs and trees. In the event this landscaping has not been completed within one (1) year following the closing or first occupancy of a home, whichever occurs first, landscaping requirements, as set forth in the Declaration shall be enforced.
        
          
        
        It is the intent that each property is to be fully landscaped and owners are encouraged to make adequate provisions for landscaping costs in their budget. Plant materials native to this climate and irrigation systems for grassed areas requiring weekly mowing, are strongly encouraged. Property owners, their builders, or other representatives are required to reduce the disruption to the community during the excavation and grading process. Consideration of snow storage and eventual runoff must be a consideration during the construction process. Existing and natural drainage corridors should be used to reduce the impact on adjacent properties.
        
          
        
    3. Fencing
        
          
        
        Fencing at Fox Run is subject to review and approval by the DRC. Fencing is allowed to provide a sense of security, provide confinement for family activity, and yet avoid complete physical and visual enclosure. It is intended that plant material integrate the fencing into the community to enhance desired visual enclosure. When used, these fences should be considered architectural extensions of a home. Fencing should be complemented by foundation plantings so the fence “disappears” into the landscape. Fencing is prohibited in the front yard of homes. Removal of the perimeter fence or any side fence to access a lot is not allowed.
        
          
        
        There are several types of fencing at Fox Run allowable only at certain locations. The perimeter privacy fence owned by the Fox Run Association which runs along Fox Run Parkway and the railroad tracks to the West will be 6ft in height. Fencing along Fox Run Parkway will be capped. The Fox Run owned fence around open space and parks will be split rail fence. The privacy fence between homes, which are owned and maintained by the home owners, will be no taller than 5 ft in height. The fencing design at Fox Run is part of the Zoning approval by the City of Northglenn in addition to being endorsed by the DRC. Therefore, there are no allowed variations in fencing design, height or color. Good Neighbor fence/Shadow Box Fence: Fencing in between neighbor homes (not on the front or open fencing facing the neighborhood). This type of fencing requires DRC approval. This fencing is only 5 foot in height. See Addendum E. See Addendum D – Fencing for fence designs. All fencing at Fox Run is to have the following finish:
        
          
        
        Perimeter Fence: Clear or Ponderosa Beige Grey

        Note that there are separate fence designs for the portion of Kimblewyck Village, which interfaces with the private drive. See Addendum E – Kimblewyck Village Fencing & Landscaping.
        
          
        
    4. Site Drainage and Grading
        
          
        
        All structures and landscape elements shall be placed on the property so that the existing topography shall be disturbed as little as possible. Finish grading shall be such as to prevent ponding or washing of water on the site and on adjacent property while providing for a rolling lawn area. Drainage shall be away from structures. Newly graded areas shall be protected against erosion. Location of topsoil stockpiles, barrow pits on site, and excess materials disposal areas are subject to DRC approval. Owners are encouraged to utilize soils engineers and landscape professionals to help ensure proper drainage is maintained.
        
          
        
        It has become increasingly evident as Fox Run develops that in certain portions of the community and on many lots that hard cape landscape improvements can negatively affect drainage. In the higher density neighborhoods of Kimblewyck and Kensington where the rear yards are small, excessive paving, in lieu of live plant material or decking, is impacting adjacent properties. This is occurring on many single families and paired home properties in the narrow lot area between houses. Runoff cannot percolate into the soil where excessive concrete or other hard surface material is used to excess. The DRC encourages the use of wooden decks or pavers/flagstone area interspersed with live plant material.
        
          
        
    5. Plant Materials
        
          
        
        All plant materials used in the landscape should be native or naturalized to the area. Plant material selection should be made from locally available nursery or garden center stock. The Colorado Nurserymen’s Association Rocky Mountain Plant Guide lists acceptable materials.
        
          
        
        The following landscape requirements shall apply to individual homeowners for the portion of their yards not landscaped by the homebuilder and for replacement or addition of landscaping.
        
          
        
        The landscape for the rear and side yard of each single family home should have a variety of deciduous and coniferous plant materials. One (1) tree is to be planted for every one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet of gross lot area. Five (5) shrubs are to be planted for every one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet of gross lot area, (7’) feet to nine (9’) feet for coniferous trees, two to two and half inch(2‐2.5”) caliper for shade trees, one and one half (1 ½”) to two inch (2”) caliper for ornamental trees, and five (5) gallon for shrubs.
        
          
        
        Front yards all had at least one tree planted by the homebuilder, one tree should be maintained within the front landscaping of all homes.
        
          
        
    6. Lawns
        
          
        
        Lawns are an important part of Fox Run primarily because the amount of land utilized as lawn is minimal. On smaller lots such as found at Fox Run, one third to one half of the front area is utilized for automobiles and pedestrians, therefore, leaving limited area for lawns. Therefore, it has been considered important to maximize lawn area. It is also important to maintain lawn area on the “short side” of each lot to avoid striping the streetscape with alternate materials. When requested, it is the DRC guideline to require live plant materials in
        
        12
        
        the “short sides” if lawn is not desired. Lawn areas should be kept at least six (6’) feet away from the foundation of the home or as recommended by a professional soils engineer or landscape professional, to ensure proper drainage is maintained.
        
          
        
    7. Foundation Plantings
        
          
        
        Planting beds should surround the foundation of each structure and provide a minimum of six (6’) feet of planting area from the homes’ foundation to the lawn areas and as provided for above to ensure proper drainage. No grass or direct irrigation should be utilized adjacent to the foundation. In all instances, watering near the foundation should be minimal (e.g., drip systems) to avoid possible structural damage to the dwelling unit.
        
          
        
    8. Front Yards and Edging
        
          
        
        All landscaping in the front yards of single family homes as installed by a builder shall be maintained by the owner in a condition at least as good as or better than the condition at the time of installation. Augmentation of the front yard landscape with additional plant materials is encouraged. Concrete curb type edges are discouraged due to the inability to revise or “grow” with the landscape as it matures.
        
          
        
    9. Rock
        
          
        
        Rock used as planting bed mulch must be light grey in color (i.e., river rock). Multi colored rock (i.e., pink granite, dark red lava rock, white or other colors) is not allowed. Large (six inches (6”) in diameter or greater) river rock, moss rock, or other “feature” rock may be used as part of the landscape. Maintenance of areas of rock can be intensive; all rock areas must be free of random grasses and weeds. Plants and groundcovers to grow over areas of rock are encouraged.
        
          
        
    10. Lighting
        
          
        
        No exterior lighting other than that provided by the builder shall be allowed on any lot except with the written approval of the DRC. Subdued exterior lighting whose light source is not visible from adjoining dwellings may be allowed by the DRC for such purposes as illuminating entrances, decks, driveways, landscaping and parking areas, and other approved purposes such as seasonal decoration. Security lighting, if consisting of large wattage or halogen bulbs of approximately 60 watts, will not be allowed since the lighting on one property would be a negative influence on adjacent properties. Porch lights or similar sized fixtures may be located over doors and may be left on throughout the night if desired. Motion lights may be utilized providing the light does not shine directly onto adjacent properties. See Section 3 K Patriotic/Seasonal/Celebratory Displays for seasonal lighting.
        
          
        
    11. Signs
        
          
        
        No permanent signs are allowed on any private property. No Fox Run resident is allowed to erect a temporary sign on any public property, i.e. lamp posts, street lights, traffic lights, etc. One temporary sign associated with the selling of a home is allowed to be placed on that unit’s lawn or in a window. See Section 3 K Patriotic/Seasonal/Celebratory Displays for allowable seasonal or celebratory signs or what may construe as “signs”. Political signs are allowed 45 days prior to an election, one sign per ballot measure may be placed on the owner’s property. Signs can be no larger than 36” x 48” and must be removed within seven (7) days after the election.

    12. Ancillary Landscape Components
        
    
      
    
    Landscape features of personal taste, which may include artificial plants; plastic, fiberglass, concrete, iron or wood animals, birds or human replicas; free standing water features; windmills; agricultural equipment; may be utilized in the yard providing the total number of items does not exceed three, maximum height is 36 inches and area covered does not exceed 3 square feet per item.

This request shall contain the reasons why the decision if felt to be unjust and any other explanatory material that would be helpful to the DRC in reviewing the situation. A meeting of all parties concerned may be arranged when warranted and the decision of the DRC at any such meeting or after reviewing this material will be final.
        
          
        
    4. Accuracy of Plans
        
          
        
        Any owner submitting plans for approval to the DRC shall be responsible for the verification and accuracy of all lot dimensions, grade, elevations, and the location of the key features of the natural terrain. Each owner shall certify to the accuracy of that before the DRC will undertake its review.
        
          
        
    5. Work in Progress
        
          
        
        The DRC may inspect all work in progress and give notice of non compliance. Absence of such inspection and notification during the construction period does not constitute either approval of the DRC of work in progress or compliance with these DAS or the Declaration. If, during construction, changes occur to an improvement which cause it to be significantly different from the approved documents, a request for approval of these changes shall be submitted to the DRC by furnishing a copy in the following manner:
        
          
        
        1. A written statement giving the reason such changes are desired.

    6. Completed Work by Homeowners
        
          
        
        1. Upon completion of any improvement by a homeowner for which approval was given by the DRC, the owner shall furnish a notice of completion to the DRC.
            
        2. Within such reasonable time as the DRC may determine, but never exceeding ten (10) days from receipt of such written notice of completion from the owner or its duly authorized representative, the DRC may inspect the improvements (dwelling). If it is found that such work was not done in strict compliance with the plan submitted or required to be submitted for its prior approval, it shall notify the owner in writing of such non compliance, specifying in reasonable detail the particulars of non compliance, and shall require the owner to remedy the same.
            
        
          
        
    7. Right of Waiver

Addendum E Shadowbox Fence

A shadowbox fence is similar to the solid‐board style except the pickets are installed on both sides of the rails with a gap between them. The pickets from one side are spaced so that they cover the space between the pickets from the other side. This creates a solid visual barrier.

Because pickets are mounted on both sides, the shadowbox style looks the same on each side.

- Length: fence length
    
- Rails per Section: 2 or 3 (3 may help with less warping)
    
- Picket Spacing: ‐1
    
- Picket Width: 5.5 (also known as 6’ slats), 5ft’ cedar pickets
