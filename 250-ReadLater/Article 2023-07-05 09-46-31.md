Affordable Plumbing showed up, and confirmed it needed replacement.   They will complete the paperwork tonight for warranty replacement -- they didn't bother to call it in immediately.. very sad.

Just got off the phone with Alex, he is saying they want $900 to replace the water heater through the warranty service.
