<td><p>Missed Therapy today because I got hyper fixated on an issue I was having. I still need to follow up and reschedule. Same with Couples therapy -- Tuesday afternoon, I believe she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been okay, but a little sad the last 24 hours. Yesterday was emotion-filled with the first session of couples work. We are to assume the best from each other. Good advice, and I will endeavor to comply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting boundaries is hard and I have started looking into online advice. I know I am making this harder than it should be.. It seems like everyone can do it much easier than I can.</p>

<td><p>I was all over the place today.. Got stuck on trying to unify one note with Monday.com again. What a waste of time.. Why???</p>
<p></p>
<p>I called my Dad and let him know all is well. He mentioned having a cavity under a crown that he has already had fixed. He focused on keeping himself healthy. I feel a little fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are some ways I can reconnect with my family?</p>
<p>What are some ways I can reconnect with my wife?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Timmy keeps switching between wanting to spend time with us -- and a lot of people pleasing behaviors.. But then he will also be a hermit. School? Personal? I wish he would feel the freedom to talk to us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stephen is taking a lot of credit hours and it is very challenging. I haven't heard from him in over a week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nelson has gone silent again. Who knows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicole is talking a lot about trust and feeling safe and secure with me. What is crazy is that I want that too and I feel like being talked to like I am an enemy is really a problem. She has the same complaint. This tells me it could all be bad perceptions. No tickling conversation spawns from no teasing. WTF is the boundary for this? It also depends on the situation. Often I will crave pets more than Bronx, other times, being touched is irritating.</p>
