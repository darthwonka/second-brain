<td><p>Am I capable of this mental health journey together with Nicole or do I need to do this alone?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Power. I come from a place where I had very little power. I was subject to the whims of authority -- parents included. Whenever I faced a challenge and felt any suffering, I was not encouraged to keep going or to get a different perspective, I was removed. Then as time went on, I was placed, finally.. I was left alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In my marriage, I see the dysfunctional power dynamics vividly. When I feel that even more power is being stripped by their assertion of a little bit of power, I would often get very loud and angry. I didn't equate the power loss as part of the trauma I experienced. I had just felt the pain of even the perception that I am losing something else. Most often, it is resentment. I would often give up power without realizing it.. I would make decisions based on how I felt Nicole would react. And.. If I "knew" the decision would upset Nicole, I would be ready to fight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would often treat myself to things I enjoy -- but only in secret. I would often do/get something for myself if I had to run downstairs to fetch or prepare something for Nicole. I will go get her whatever she wants and am pretty much expected to go get the morning coffee and the evening desserts. Honestly, I am making very tasty unhealthy decisions a lot -- especially in the last 6 months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trying to think of healthier ways to give and take power from what I wrote above.. I need to accept direction as well as do my own research on things. I need to stand firm on my boundaries and self-worth. Speak boldly of the peanut butter I will consume. Proudly admit to -- or even more boldly -- outright let Nicole know if I got to masturbate (so much shame here in my head). If I don't want to do something -- say so. Ideally, because I love Nicole, I should also remember to come up with an alternative that she may enjoy or find useful/helpful.</p>

<td><p>Birthday week continues later this week with Stephen's 20th birthday. Nicole went ahead and spearheaded a 'your grown.. Here is $100 in your account' birthday. Which does reduce stress. But I had some ideas of things to get the boys.. But you know.. Maybe Nicole is on to something.. Get little gifts throughout the year stick to a 'treat yo self' birthday check. 'dig it.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm out of sorts with the timing of my day.. I feel like I am simultaneously not working enough and too much.</p>
<p>I'll talk to Nicole and see how she is feeling about it.</p>
