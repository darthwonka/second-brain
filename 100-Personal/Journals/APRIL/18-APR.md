<td><p>Good day today. I got a lot done but then was a little hyperfixated on a template.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lots of birthdays this month. And more coming up. I actually remembered one with a reminder in my calender.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That reminds me.. I need to look at the automation sites as it looks like my task lists are being updated with garbage data. Gotta fix that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Boobies.</p>

<td><p>The Esteem module. Two parts, really. 1. Your esteem towards yourself and 2. Esteem towards others. The former is how you feel about yourself. What other people think about me does not impact my self-esteem. While I do make mistakes, I also learn a lot from them and get better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While it is true that I have lost faith in most people and have lowered my expectations with them, I still hold Nicole in high regard. The exceptions to this are when I feel hurt and she just doesn't understand or tries to belittle or negate the experience. I have found through talking to her that this is her attempt to reduce my pain.. I don't have a good solution. But I do need to make sure I stick to some healthy boundaries so that my temper is under control.</p></td>
