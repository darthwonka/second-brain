<td><p>Day three on Wellbutrin. It is okay so far. Still awaiting a lifting of the sexual side-effects.</p>

<p>Setting Boundaries Worksheet</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situation: Missed several days of work due to medical treatment. Coworker is asking what happened, but I don't want to share -- too personal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't feel comfortable sharing the details with you, but I will tell you this: they were not life-threatening.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situationl: Brother asks to watch his kids Saturday morning, but I have plans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That sounds like so much fun! Unfortunately I have already made plans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situation: Coworker is upset with perrformance review,yells and slamming their fists on the desk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I see you are very upset, but this is making me uncomfortable. Grab me a little later on if you want to talk about it when you have calmed down. Maybe there is something tangible we can work on to improve it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situation: Sales person comes to the door during dinner. You try to politely show disinterest, but they keep giving their sales pitch. You want to get back to dinner.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do you have a card and references for your services? I cannot talk right now, but I am willing to look at your literature and call if we are interested. [no card].. That is a shame. Shut door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situation: invited a friend over for the evening, but now it is getting late. You would like to get ready for bed but your friend seems unware of how late it is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>What a great night! I am getting tired, let's call it a night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Situation : A good friend asks you out on a date. You are not interested in being more than friends. You would like to let them down clearly, but gently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I consider you a close friend. I wish I felt the same way, but I don't. I would like to get lunch, however!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Journal:</p>
<p>I had an alright work day. I got lost in a lot of details and I really should have reached out for help in what I am looking for -- or even explain it to someone who might offer a better way to look at this. Just hyperfixated on sleuthing the issues but to no avail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicole worked a long day with a client that needed a lot of work.. She ordered lunch, but had to wait an additional 2 hours to get to eat it. When she didn't see it on the table, she came into my office to complain that I put it into the fridge. I tried to calmly explain I didn't do it, but she got more angry. Come to find out after tears and lots of negative feelings, the lunch was in the microwave -- which is a good place for it. She explained that I hurt her feelings when I announced that I needed a shower. She explained that the rules had changed (* a while back we established house rules for shower days so that she would not get cold showers.) I acknowledged that we did agree on days and that we were also asking the other folks if they were planning on taking one before just deciding. I don't like the language as it does sound like we are asking permission. I'll think about it.. 'do you mind?' 'I was thinking of taking a shower, what are your plans?"</p>
