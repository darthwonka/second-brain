<td><p>Feeling pretty good today. I got a lot done in spite of countless meetings scattered throughout the day. Nicole and I barely talked today. No comment.. Just an observation. I went and found all of my cousins' spotify albums and added all the tracks to the playlist. Now, Just set to repeat.. I know it is pathetic.. But I am still getting back on my feet.</p>

<p>Stephens Birthday is tomorrow. He is going to be 20. I don't think I will see him in person, but I might do a video chat with him. Maybe snap a screenshot. He wants to spend it with friends, I get it. I think I will see him on the weekend, however.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Time to wrap this up. Paul -- don't give up without a fight. I have no idea what that must be like.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is okay to have sissy boundaries for a little while, as you get stronger and more skilled, you will get better and set more reasonable boundaries. Boundaries are your comfort.</p></td>

<td>After building out a linux server to handle packet forwarding, I went on to work on getting Duo working in linux. The instructions sucked or I missed a critical step. I managed to recover the system and restored the authentication settings. PITA. Tomorrow I can work a little on this, but I need to focus on two other projects.. The second linux server for splunk and think about/write about our linux goals for this year. I feel like I need to present some kind of plan for Ian to share with the higherups.</td>
