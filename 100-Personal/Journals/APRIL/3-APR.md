<td><p>I had a rough birthday weekend. Friday night I went to the movies with my boys and Nicole. It was a good time.. I wish the movie was better, but we all seemed to enjoy it. Saturday, we didn't do much. Sunday I took the boys to see my parents for Nelson and I's Birthday. It was okay.</p>
<p>What really hurt me was when we started talking about summer camps and private schools and my dad was recalling my brother's and I's summer to Culver military camp. It brought me back. They didn't remember anything about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told them that I think I broke my toe on day 2 -- but still had the instructor in riflery stop everyone and said "Don't fuck with him, he doesnâ€™t miss". My parents didn't remember any of it. One of the few times in my childhood where I was praised, and they don't remember. It isn't a big deal and I don't fault them for forgetting. But it hurt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicole said that we need to accept and recognize who our parents are and don't hate, but just know who they are and fix myself. I am trying.</p>

<td><p>I got my new meds today. I started on the Adderall this afternoon.. I can't tell the difference between that and the dextroamphetamine. This is good. Tomorrow I will reduce one of my meds and add a new one to see if it improves things.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't know what to do with the news of my cousin. I saw that he and his family (my dad's sister) are raising money. I have nothing to give right now. I feel terrible for them. I also want to reach out, but I didn't. I didn't respond in any way to the posts or send any messages out. I am paralyzed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to make love to my wife. But she is in pain from shaving 'for me'. Which of course, is how she said it. I feel bad about that. I don't know what to think or do.. So I have just accepted that sex is still off the table. What am I supposed to do? Ask for sexual favors? And when it is taking too long? I feel bad that it is taking too long. I don't even want to go there. I feel so stuck, so sad about that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm trying to stay up-beat and immune to pain so that she wants to hang with me without me getting upset with her. Healthy? No. But I am tired. I am sad, I am tired. I just want to do my work, do some chores and have some time to myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am also too tired to put forth the kind of emotional energy it seems to take to make her happy with me. I journal now to try and shift gears and get to a good place. Let's see how that goes.</p>
