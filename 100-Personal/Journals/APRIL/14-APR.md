<td><p>Today was okay.. Very quiet. Nicole had 2 consults and 1 color. She seems in good spirits today.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I keep forgetting to do something for her or for the house.. Don't remember what.</p>

<td><p>Frustrating day of trying to get the AD authentication working. I can't seem to make it work. It worked like once. This is very confusing. I have went through all of the documentation I can find.. It seems to be kerberos authentication -- probably between the AD server and the krb5 settings on the workstation.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do this weekend -- I am supposed to help with patching, but I was ghosted.</p>
