<td><p>This week is the esteem module of therapy. I have struggled a lot with esteem. I don't think I was often allowed to struggle and succeed. I would be yanked instead of guided. This left me with a lot of fear and feeling very low about myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since diagnosis and this therapy, I have gained a lot more esteem. I still have my moments of weakness, but they seem fewer and fewer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicole and I had another miscommunication today after therapy. She came in, but the way she came in put me in a state of alert.. Not necessarily anxiety, but I felt something was amiss. She saw this look on my face and immediately became defensive. We talked it out, but it took a minute to understand that we were each reading our faces wrong. There were other issues, but I also feel like they were bits taken out of context. In the end, I feel like we were able to resolve our differences in a conversation rather than a 3 hour fight to hurt each other with words.</p>

<p>Good day, overall.</p></td>

<td>Got HAProxy configured -- just need to enter the server names and restart the service. This should be ready to try out tomorrow. W00t! Truth be told, I made this way more complicated by over thinking the problem. It was a little embarrassing for me to ask for help, but I did it.</td>
