This time, I got paid and was able to pay off the most critical things: 1. $1000 overdraft, CO taxes, Premier Members Feb payment, and power. She said, what felt flippantly, 'did you pay Timmy?' I felt bad, pressured. I tried to tell her that I paid more critical things, but I think that came across poorly. She accused me of not appreciating her contributions as well as me having a bad attitude towards giving back.

I am really excited.. Several problems I have been having with this setup may have been solved.

I found both tutorials and links into visual code for onenote macros! I can't wait to try and code some!

The other thing I found was a couple more guides for getting the namecheap api pages up and running. I wish I was more comfortable with how it works, I feel like there are a couple concepts I am not yet grasping.

Tomorrow I hope to do a lot of dev work on Nicole shopping site as well as possibly my own onenote projects.
