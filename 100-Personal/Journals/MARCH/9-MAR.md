# Journal Entry

#

1. My wife was angry and upset. She mentioned the boys and I. She was yelling about how so many of her things are misplaced, lost, or broken by us.
2. Habit. It is like a knee-jerk reaction to feeling injustice. Had I been a little more receptive, I *might* have seen that she was just upset and needed reassurance or help.
3. I cannot read Nicole's mind. All I am seeing are the physical and verbal representations of what she is feeling. Where I perceived anger, she was upset.
4. No.
5. 'Must'. Like I cannot let any injustice go silent.
6. It is very much defensive. It doesn't address what Nicole is feeling.
7. I feel like I have been falsely accused of a lot of things. I also feel shamed --- like all of the attention is on me, and it is not a good feeling.
8. It is possible that Nicole is blaming, but there was other evidence to suggest that she was already upset before losing the item. Venting is hard to deal with.
9. The stuck point is a knee jerk from the immediate pain from feeling wrongly accused. The feeling is such a strong feeling of injustice, shame, and powerlessness. I rarely feel like i am vindicated.
10. Feeling like I am being accused of some wrongdoing hurts. that pain detracts from the actual issue of my wife's upset. I don't know what to do.
