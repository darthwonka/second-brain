<td><p>Had to work late tonight to get some things done that I couldn't get done during the afternoon because of a friend visiting. While she said it was okay to work, it felt like there was definite time limit on that. It could be that the limit itself is my own fear and guilt. One of the worst months of our marriage occurred around a large migration of users and office move of Studio Completiva. I worked every Friday for over 8 hours trying to get things up and running. While this was happening, I would be getting complaints to which I would respond by trying harder to leave the building sooner.. But the problems wouldn't allow that to happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It looked bad because I would start the day with a poor estimate of work time to Nicole, then , either not communicate the issue. Instead, I made excuses, I made false promises to leave much sooner than I would actually leave. This month took a large chunk of trust out of the relationship. Today feels like a repeat of that time.</p></td>

<td>Got the Networking team's Ansible server built tonight. Tomorrow morning I need to finish configuring the box and finding out what it's permanent name and network location will be. I will clone/move/copy the vm to the permanent location and setup access accounts for those who need it. Time-permitting, get ldap AD authentication working on it.</td>
