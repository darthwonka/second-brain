I wish my wife and I were more sexually intimate. It seems like there is always a problem. I see that there is often a lack of communication between us and I am much to blame for it. I am not sad, not really happy, but not really sure what to say about that. I guess Productive.

Modified brute.py to be a little more efficient. Instead of looping through the open creds file, I popped the contents into an array and parse per host. This seems to be going well. Output is as expected and I don't see any serious problems on this run. It also includes a cleaned and sorted host list to hit as well as more root passwords I grabbed from the password manager.
