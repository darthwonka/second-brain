Journal

The Best part of today was that the Credit cards I needed to work, did. I was able to get dogfood, my meds.. Good times.

This morning Nicole woke up after having a nightmare. She wanted hugs. I naturally complied. This was all fine. I got up to use the rest room, repositioned to keep cuddling, but may have been a little too frisky and got a bad signal. She was very upset. I don't think I overreacted, but we did let sleep happen and when I awoke, we had a talk about her nightmare. Apparently I had died and she was at my grave and would not leave.

It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't a fight. This is progress..

She is very mushy today and affectionate. I wish this was all the time.
