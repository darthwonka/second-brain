Journal

Got my second paycheck from CPI today and paid down a couple overdue bills. I had to transfer money to both Stephen and Timmy for both payback and so their accounts didn't bounce. I had a frustrating talk with Nicole about the money issue -- which made me cranky.

The crux is that she thinks I don't want to pay anyone back -- or I am prioritizing credit card companies over the family when things are tight. I believe I am trying to be surgical with payments to maximize what I have left for other things. I have to pay the family back with a smile.

Of course, this means that I am once again out of money to get things that I want or need and I will have to ask Nicole to help with purchasing them. I don't like this at all.

I am not willy-nilly paying off whatever I want.. I put thought into it. I am trying to get caught up with several late payments -- spanning over 1 month over both credit cards and services like power and internet.

This is almost certainly a misunderstanding.

Power, internet, car insurance, and colorado tax payment was done. I also setup a payment for the delinquent HELOC account.
