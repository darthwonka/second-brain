Another [Stuck Point](onenote:Lists.one#Stuck Points&section-id={5BAB2C5C-CBC9-432E-B278-6BBB5183C92D}&page-id={D06F2BF3-6479-45C5-B389-FC90A4A81A3A}&end&base-path=https://salusitgroupllc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/michael_salusitgroup_com/Documents/Notebooks/Personal)

1. Evidence

		a.  Nicole has reacted with a lot of hostility while being woken up accidently.

		b.  When I expressed I needed more sleep, I was met with hostility and annoyance.

		c.  She 'accidently' tapped my shoulder 4 times. She accidently raised the bed (more believable), and she apparently left out the 10 minutes of mumbling about being ignored. She accidently asked Alexa what time it was after I snoozed my alarm.

		d.  Against: She says it was all a big misunderstanding and she didn't realize I was not fully awake or planning to wake up. Everything except for the bed raising up is consistent with past behavior. I was cranky. I was already expecting a fight and it is possible that I also misunderstood things. I may not have been listening perfectly with her 'apology'/diatribe about how I need to give her more grace.

2. Habit or fact?

		a.  I think this is a little of both. I am not allowed to complain is often met with 'you complain about everything' and similar statements. When Nicole feels offended by me, she will let me know. Any apology followed by explanation leads to disaster.

		b.  Habit side: I woke up expecting a problem and got one. I was pre-annoyed and probably responded inappropriately regardless of her tone.

3. I was definitely still very groggy so I may not have been completely aware of my surroundings. She claimed to be in a pretty good mood prior to me 'getting upset'.
4. Yes.. 'Everyone' would be an all term.
5. Yes. Never get to be upset.
6. It is focused on past experiences and my own anxiety over waking her up. It doesn't even give my wife a chance. It may not have mattered what she said in response.
7. I am not sure.
8. It is certainly more of a possible outcome rather than a likely outcome.
9. The sense of injustice and feeling dismissed or even silenced. Certainly no facts there, just feelings.
10. It would seem that this definitely pre-dates sleeping with other people. I suspect this comes from family and from our own politics. Especially since the birth of my two sisters, my feelings have always been ignored or dismissed. If I am consoled at all, it is to be explained how it wasn't really a wrong to me, it was a misunderstanding -- or some other excuse. It always felt like I got it wrong with my reactions. And rather than let me express them I was left to cry inconsolably in my room alone. Eventually calming, but I remember looping over the wrong quite a bit.

** Side note: I wonder if my propensity to 'loop' in a conversation, as I was made aware of, is related to this.
