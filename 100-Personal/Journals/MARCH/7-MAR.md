# Journal Entry

Today was a rough session. We explored the stuck point regarding not communicating my needs to Nicole. The idea of sharing struggles or problems with my wife seem to come from when I was very young and dealing with my Mom who had lost my dad. She went off the deep end emotionally and I did not feel that I registered at all.

My feeling on this was that I could not express any of my needs or issues because that would just add to her emotional distress. Let's just say that the more distress she suffered, the less we saw her.

So, this is purely from the mind of a 4-10 year old. There are not a lot of facts backing this Stuck Point. It is 90% emotion.

Left to figure out how to deal or not deal with my own issues has led to a lot of isolationist tendencies.

To counter this, I think I just need to trust my partner more and, while it is possible it may be too much for them to bear, it will probably be okay.
