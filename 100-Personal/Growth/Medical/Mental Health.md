William received his masters degree in Marriage, Family, and Child Counseling through California State University Fresno. He has 4 years of experience working with adults and adolescents challenged by personality disorders, ADHD, trauma, depression, and/or anxiety based difficulties.

William is motivated and passionate to provide quality mental health services to those who may not normally seek out help due to life circumstances, cultural norms, or living in underserved communities.

In his spare time, he enjoys backpacking outdoors, making furniture for his family, spending time with his nephews, and learning how to cook new recipes.
