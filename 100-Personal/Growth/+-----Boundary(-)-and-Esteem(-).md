V

One Down - Shame-based

Boundaryless:

Boundaryless/ One Down: Desperation (love me at all costs). Dependency

Boundaryless/One Up: Demand Control and Anger. Violence. Demanding then Retaliatory. All Abusers live here.

Wall Off/ One Up: Achiever. Meanness. Passive Aggressive. You are not worthy of my attention. Indifference, mean

Wall Off/One Down: Resignation/Depression. Futile.

Boundryless - dependent. You are the temperature of the rock.

- love dependent (love addict)

Walled Off: Love avoidant. Disengaged. Protected, not connected. Mistrust for intimacy.

Relationships

Harmony then Disillusionment. Normal marital hatred.

Disharmony/Disillusion

All relationships:

Harmony

Disruption

Disharmony - Adaptive child strategies

Repair

Relational Reckoning: Am I getting enough in this relationship to make grieving what I am not getting worth my while?

Being right - Objective reality has no place in personal relationships.

Controlling your partner - People don't like being controlled.

Unbridled self-expression -

Functional moves in a relationship help positively change your partner.

Retaliation - Punishing somebody will never bring them to accountability.

Withdrawal - Resentment is not acceptance. Don't lie to yourself. Withdrawal is not

acceptance. Unilateral and a rupture.

Functional moves in a relationship help positively change your partner.

Every offender thinks they are a victim.

Passive aggression is retaliation. It never works.

Who are you to tell another adult what they should or should not be doing.

Refusing to engage.

Losing strategy profile:

What are my most usual losing strategy profile when you are knocked out of being a functional adult.?

The adaptive child is a child in adult's clothing: It is the adult in the child's eyes.

Intrusion builds walls.

The adaptive child is self-preservation. It does not want a relationship nor intimacy.

Our culture loves adaptive children, and actually fears functional adults.

There is no redeeming value in harshness. There is nothing harshness does that loving firmness can't do better. Doesn't do better. Into the light of your Nuanced flexible yielding humble, forgiving functional adult. It is a better life.

Letter to your adaptive child.

My dear <adaptive child>

1. Thank you.
2. These are the things you have given me.
3. These are the things you have cost me.
4. I am here now, the functional adult. You can relax. I am in charge.

Core Negative Image: The heart of your worst enemy.

1. My own:
2. My Partner:
3. My partner's view of me:

The more CNI triggers partner's CNI and in loop.

Partners CNI of you is an exaggerated version you at your worst. There is an ounce of truth to your partner's CNI view of you. Accept the truth part.

Make your CNI of your partner explicit with words. Write it out on cards. 3 to 5 adjectives.

Short, sweet and to the point.

When they are treating you as cni, step away and write down what you think her CNI is of you.

Your partner's CNI of you is a compass. A compass that points to the OPPOSITE direction to where you want to go.

If you act out in a way that CONFIRMS your partner's CNI of you, it will trigger them. If you act in a way OPPOSITE to your partner's CNI of you, they calm.

This only works through your Functional Adult.
