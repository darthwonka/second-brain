This is a list of non-negotiable, unacceptable things that I will no longer tolerate from myself.

- Responding in anger: I may respond, instead, with irritation, concern, upset, but not anger.
- Fighting: Starting or extending a fight - fighting is not productive
- Hurtful things: I will not say things that are designed to inflict pain. They may be true, but I will not say them.

I have noticed that I have been doing a lot of negative things lately. I don't speak my needs or feelings as I should and I build up resentment.
