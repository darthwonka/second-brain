Example: Setting up Workspace

I need to create a productive work area.

1. Clean
2. Items and tools are in a predictable location
3. Office layout is non-distracting, warm, and pleasant
4. Have a plan for clutter, if possible

Approximate Duration:

Deadline:

To achieve this:

1. Remove all trash and non-work items from office
2. Sweep/mop floor
3. Gather all mail and separate to file, shred, or dispose/recycle
4. File important papers
5. Assign locations for tools, equipment, and office supplies
6. Sort through desktop and store items appropriately
7. Cable management

My life will flow and allow me to focus on tasks as well as transitioning to other tasks.

Time saved with knowing where equipment is when I need something.

A little less stressful.

Music or maybe audio book to help pass the time. Smoke a little beforehand too.

The piece of mind in having things in order is a decent motivator, but I should probably think of something more physically rewarding. Maybe upon completion, I can spend an hour or two messing with my bass and music setup.

Do this for my morning routine
