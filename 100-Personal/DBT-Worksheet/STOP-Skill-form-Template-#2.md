Describe crisis situation that happened to you. Then describe your use of the STOP skill.

CRISIS EVENT 1: Rate level of distress (0-100)

| BEFORE: | AFTER: |
|---------|--------|
| 70      | 50     |

**Prompting Event for my distress (who, what, when, where): What triggered the state of crisis?**

First look at my oldest son's school work showed a missing and a late assignment. This is after two years of failing classes for the same reason. I immediately felt rage and betrayal.

**Behavior you are trying to stop:**

Check the steps you used below

Stop

Take a step back

Observe

Proceed Mindfully

**Describe what you did:**

I stepped away from the screen. I took several deep breaths. When I confronted him, I remained calm and explained that due to his past performance record, late and missing assignments are not tolerated at all.

I had to remind him that I was not yelling as he became defensive. I told him, after he poorly explained the reasons, that he needs to get these grades corrected immediately.

**Describe the outcome of using skills**

I remained calm, but irritated.

Circle a number to indicate how effective the skill was in helping you tolerate the distress and cope with the situation (keeping you from doing something to make the situation worse). Use the following scale:

| I still couldn't stand the situation. Even for one more minute |    | I was able to cope somewhat. At least for a little while. It helped somewhat |    | I could use skills, tolerated distress, and resisted problem urges |
