Describe crisis situation that happened to you. Then describe your use of the STOP skill.

CRISIS EVENT 1: Rate level of distress (0-100)

| BEFORE: | AFTER: |
|---------|--------|
| 60      | 40     |

**Prompting Event for my distress (who, what, when, where): What triggered the state of crisis?**

My wife has been under a lot of stress. She started complaining about disrespectful and selfish treatment she has been receiving from our kids. Shortly after listing out all the things they did to disrespect her, she turned the focus to me and how I have been responsible for their behavior.

This immediately triggered feelings of pain, hopelessness. I then felt myself get very defensive.

**Behavior you are trying to stop:** the defensiveness and feelings of being attacked/criticism.

Check the steps you used below

Stop

Take a step back

Observe

Proceed Mindfully

**Describe what you did:**

I felt the pain and all the negative emotions and in my head.. I stopped and took a step back. Observed my emotions, and the hurt my wife was feeling. But I couldn't completely control my emotions.

**Describe the outcome of using skills**

I said a few things defensively before I could get a handle on things. But I could not seem to clear my head enough to proceed mindfully -- just enough to not say anymore that I would regret.

Circle a number to indicate how effective the skill was in helping you tolerate the distress and cope with the situation (keeping you from doing something to make the situation worse). Use the following scale:

| I still couldn't stand the situation. Even for one more minute |    | I was able to cope somewhat. At least for a little while. It helped somewhat |    | I could use skills, tolerated distress, and resisted problem urges |
