Parts are who knows where and I have no idea what is happening. 
We have an appointment on the 30th with Sears Home Services, no clue other than that.

On the phone with Sears home warranty
The supervisor mentioned that the parts are under manufacturer's warranty and that I**I** need to reach out to them directly to get the parts ordered.
