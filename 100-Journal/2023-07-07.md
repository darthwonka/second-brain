I have been feeling very down lately.   I don't know why things feel hopeless.  
Nicole wants me to talk to the doctor to see if it could be medication-related.   I just think a lot is happening that I cannot control or stop and it scares me.  

I still have not actually called anyone about the statefarm claim but I did send an email.   I did not receive a response yet. 

It is Friday night, and I think Nicole and I are alone. I should try and make this evening special. 

Here I am Journaling.
