# Journal

### June 19, 2023 5:20 PM
Good day, even though the working part was unexpected. 
I saw a post recently where someone said they wanted to encrypt a file for journaling.   I had a mild scare. 
I should probably do this.  

Things to do: 
- [x] Setup email account(s) for mrandmrsbelanger.com for the admin/webmaster and maybe a couple others.   #mrandmrsbelanger.com ➕


> [!todo] -  Write down things to remember and pick a reasonable due date
>  #correctme you can put tasks right in this block or just near it.
