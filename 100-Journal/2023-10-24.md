### Who do you work for?
I was thinking about this question and what occurred to me was to name my employer.. But then I had this other thought. 
>[!quote]  Who do you work **for**?

The word "for" in this sentence.  It is the *reason*.    I work for my wife and my kids.   
#### Loyalties
There was a time where the 'for' in who do I work for, would have been the company.   I was grateful for the work, wanted to help them succeed and did my best.  This often included long hours of working.    When I got married and started having a family, that mindset never changed.   I still felt that the job had priority  -- had my loyalty -- even at the expense.   Time being the most precious.

Think about loyalty when you are thinking about who you work for.  

I want to explore this thought over the next few weeks and be mindful of who I am actually working for.
