I am looking at a lot of home improvement projects happening all at once!  I cannot believe it is all happening.  
I am worried a lot about things lately.   I am trying to be mindful and navigate everything, but I find myself slipping and not journeling as much as I need to.  

I am looking at some digital garden ideas.. But, if it is even possible, I seem to be missing a concept or two for making it all work.
