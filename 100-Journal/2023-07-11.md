## Today I appreciate...
Good Service
Helpful family
Loving wife 
Working appliances
Plenty of Ice and hot water
Hot showers


## I want to manifest...
I always pay my bills and have plenty left for things that make me and my family happy. 
People just want to give me money
I can figure out any problem. 
I can control my emotions
I may not be able to control others, but I can control myself.
