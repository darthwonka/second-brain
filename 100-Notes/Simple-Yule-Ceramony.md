Something that is very simple and easy to do is create a small Yule altar and make an offering to the God and Goddess. This is also a great thing that you can do if you have children who you would like to introduce to earth-based practices because it has similar tones to things leaving cookies for Santa. What are we really doing as kids when we leave cookie and milk for Santa? We're leaving an offering of cakes and ale to the spirit of giving that is embodies by the mythical figure of Santa and in return we receive generosity and abundance through gifts {which just happen to take a physical form rather than a spiritual form}.

Lay out an altar cloth on your chosen surface and gather three candles, one white, one red and one green.

Place the red candle on the left for the Goddess, the green candle to the right for the God and the white candle in the center for unity and hope to light the way for the God's return.

Place a chalice of mulled wine or cider on the altar along with a plate of nuts or sugar cookies. Take a little time to meditate on the meaning of Yule and the winter season, thinking about what you hope to see be reborn in your life right now. Take time to also send some prayers of hope out into the world as well.

Light you candles going from left to right; light the red one thanking the Goddess for keeping the God safe through his transformation and carrying him back to us.

Light the white candle to light the path for the God.

Then light the green one to welcome the God back as the Child of Light.

As you light these candles you can use different chants or speak words either prepared or in the moment from the heart. You can chant, drum, use a rattle, or do something else that will help you to call or sing back the God. When you feel his return offer up and partake of the cake and ale, leaving some on the altar for the God and Goddess.
