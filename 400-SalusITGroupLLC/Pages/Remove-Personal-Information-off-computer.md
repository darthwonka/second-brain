Below I have outlined two methods for removing all of your personal data from a computer running Windows 10.

The first option is the most involved, but the friendliest way to proceed. It is friendly because it leaves all of the applications installed for the next user.

The second option is easier -- but far more destructive. It will essentially format the drive and reinstall windows. All user data and installed programs will be deleted.


# Remove Account with personal info, keep OS and Applications

## STEP 1 - Create an Administrator account to do the work.

1. Click on the **Start** button to open the Start menu. Click on the gear icon (**Settings)**.

4. Enter the name for your new local account, password and password hint. Click **Next**.

PROTIP: Since this is not an important account, choose the same word for each of the three hints.

5. Once you've clicked Next, you'll be taken back to the Accounts screen and but now you can see the new account. By default, the newly-created account is a standard/limited account. From there click on the new user account you just created and then **Change account type**.
