A Number associated with the screen will appear on that screen.

Select the screen you wish to enlarge or enhance by clicking on the display icon in the display settings

Scroll down to see options for the selected display:

![Scale and layout Change the size of text, apps, and other items 175% Advanced scaling settings Resolution 3840 x 2160 (Recommended) Orientation Landscape](../media/Pages-Enlarge-screen-for-presentations-image2.png){width="4.940277777777778in" height="3.5118055555555556in"}

Try changing the Percentage of scaling.

If that doesn't work, you can try choosing the display number to get the natural resolution of the display under the multiple displays section.

![Multiple displays Duplicate these displays Extend these displays Show only on 1 Show only Advanced display settings](../media/Pages-Enlarge-screen-for-presentations-image3.png){width="4.565277777777778in" height="2.946527777777778in"}

You can also try the 'Extend these displays' and see if that helps.
